#### About Me
I'm 21 years old and a student. My way in Frontend Development became some years ago, when I tried to create my own projects in social networks (primarly Instagram and Telegram). So I was in charge of copywriting and designing layouts for posts. That time I realized that I like spend much on design. That was my favourite part of the work. 

After a while I decided to become a UX/UI designer. In this period I was spending much on exploring design patterns and practice. My main tool was Figma. Using this tool I've created some landing pages and other little projects. During my internship in self-develompent organisation of my city I was responsible for designing layouts for one new project that was being launched when I got there. After this internship I realized that it would be great if I studied HTML and CSS, because for any designer it's crucial to speak with developers the same language. 

Six months have passed since the beginning of the study of these two technologies. One month ago I've been starting to master JavaScript. But I’m afraid that I’m missing something important. Something, that is vital of importance to become truly superb frontend developer. That's why I'm here. I believe this course will help me to increase my knowledge and provide me with new job opportunities. This is what I was looking for.
